This repository contains the ImageJ macro used in the manuscript entitled "Reduced PaxillinB localization to cell-substrate adhesions promotes cell migration in Dictyostelium" by Fierro Morales et al. 2024. This manuscript investigates PaxillinB's role in regulation cell-substrate adhesions during single cell migration in the model Amoebozoan Dictyostelium discoideum. The link to the paper will be updated here when accepted for publication. To identify and quantify PaxillinB punctae in an unbiased manner, we developed a semi-automated image processing pipeline on ImageJ. Images of migrating Dictyostelium cells were taken using Yokogawa CSU-W1 spinning disc confocal scanner unit, Gataca Systems Live-SR super resolution module and Kinetix 22 Scientific CMOS (sCMOS) camera for super resolution spinning disc confocal microscopy with NIS AR software. Data for punctae number and area were presented in graphs in Figures 1H, 4A and S4A.
